# Description

This code is used to replicate the results of the paper. The code implements algorithms to compute annealed average Renyi entropy using (a) Monte Carlo method and (b) partition function method (for corresponding planar Ising model). Dependensies: the code requires installed packages Numpy >= 1.19.2, Scipy >=0.19.1, and Matplotlib >=3.3.2.

## Lattice structure

The structure of Ising triangular lattice generated by running the file: /planar_ising/generate_lattice_plot.py

The result is illustrated below:

The resulting lattice shows different couplings for the corresponding classical Ising model using randomly generated measurements, as denoted in this plot.

The lattice size can be changed in the file using parameters Lph (physical length/number of qubits) and Tph (physical time/circuit depth). The program automatically recalculates corresponding lattice dimensions and marks the specific couplings. The arrangement measurements can be manually accessed by changing the boolean array "meas".

## Collapse plot

The collapse plot including critical point and critical exponent generated by running the file: /planar_ising/generate_collapse_plot.py

The result is demonstrated below:

The order parameter system-size scaling can be used to derive the critical point $p_c$ and the critical exponent $\nu$. The evaluated critical parameters are printed upon running the file. More samples can be generated and stored upon setting the parameter "samples" to any float number. The function "overwrite" resets the data files and starts sampling from scratch.

## Error plot

The error analysis plot is generated by running the file: /planar_ising/generate_precision_plot.py

The result is demonstrated below:

The first plot demonstrates how quickly the value of entropy saturates as parameter $\Gamma$ increases in the limit in Eq. (S.63) of the Supplement. The circuit is of size N and depth N. The second plot illustrates the error's decay with an increase of $Gamma$ by comparing it to the Monte Carlo simulation result. The dashed line shows the asymptotics of the exponential error suppression. The third graph illustrates the error caused by insufficient digital precision of $\Gamma$. Fro this plot, it follows that the digital precision should increase at least as the number N.
